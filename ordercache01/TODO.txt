1. DONE. OrderHasher and OrderComparer with noexcept.
2. Matching method optimization:
	* Iterator with filter (???). We dont copy elements from a collection. Just iterate skipping some elements (filtering out).
	* A list? Easy depleted elements removal. Less elements to iterate over.
3. An index optimization:
	* References instead of string copies?
	* Some other collection than vector?
